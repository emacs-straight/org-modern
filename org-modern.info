1 Introduction
**************

This package implements a modern style for your Org buffers using font
locking and text properties.  The package styles headlines, keywords,
tables and source blocks.  The styling is configurable, you can disable
or modify the style of each syntax element individually via the
‘org-modern’ customization group.

   <https://github.com/minad/org-modern/blob/screenshots/example.gif?raw=true>

   The screenshots shows example.org (example.org) with
‘org-modern-mode’ turned on and off.  The elegant theme featured in the
screenshot is modus-operandi
(https://protesilaos.com/emacs/modus-themes).

   Since this package adjusts text styling, it depends on your font
settings.  You should ensure that your ‘variable-pitch’ and
‘fixed-pitch’ fonts combine harmonically and have approximately the same
height.  As default font, I recommend variants of the Iosevka
(https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka) font, e.g., Iosevka Term Curly.
‘org-modern-mode’ tries to adjust the tag label display based on the
value of ‘line-spacing’.  This looks best if ‘line-spacing’ has a value
between 0.1 and 0.4 in the Org buffer.  Larger values of ‘line-spacing’
are not recommended, since Emacs does not center the text vertically
(see Emacs bug#76390
(https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=76390)).

2 Configuration
***************

The package is available on GNU ELPA and MELPA.  You can install the
package with ‘package-install’.  Then ‘org-modern’ can be enabled
manually in an Org buffer by invoking ‘M-x org-modern-mode’.  In order
to enable ‘org-modern’ for all your Org buffers, add ‘org-modern-mode’
to the Org mode hooks.

     ;; Option 1: Per buffer
     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-modern-mode)
     (add-hook 'org-agenda-finalize-hook #'org-modern-agenda)

     ;; Option 2: Globally
     (with-eval-after-load 'org (global-org-modern-mode))

   Try the following more extensive setup in ‘emacs -Q’ to reproduce the
looks of the screenshot above after the installation of ‘org-modern’.

     ;; Minimal UI
     (package-initialize)
     (menu-bar-mode -1)
     (tool-bar-mode -1)
     (scroll-bar-mode -1)
     (modus-themes-load-operandi)

     ;; Choose some fonts
     ;; (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "Iosevka")
     ;; (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :family "Iosevka Aile")
     ;; (set-face-attribute 'org-modern-symbol nil :family "Iosevka")

     ;; Add frame borders and window dividers
     (modify-all-frames-parameters
      '((right-divider-width . 40)
        (internal-border-width . 40)))
     (dolist (face '(window-divider
                     window-divider-first-pixel
                     window-divider-last-pixel))
       (face-spec-reset-face face)
       (set-face-foreground face (face-attribute 'default :background)))
     (set-face-background 'fringe (face-attribute 'default :background))

     (setq
      ;; Edit settings
      org-auto-align-tags nil
      org-tags-column 0
      org-catch-invisible-edits 'show-and-error
      org-special-ctrl-a/e t
      org-insert-heading-respect-content t

      ;; Org styling, hide markup etc.
      org-hide-emphasis-markers t
      org-pretty-entities t
      org-agenda-tags-column 0
      org-ellipsis "…")

     (global-org-modern-mode)

   An alternative setup, using ‘use-package’ and modifying some of the
display entities:

     (use-package org-modern
       :custom
       (org-modern-block-indent t)  ; to enable org-modern-indent when org-indent is active
       (org-modern-hide-stars nil)
       (org-modern-todo-faces
        '(("STARTED" :foreground "yellow")
          ("CANCELED" org-special-keyword :inverse-video t :weight bold)))
       (org-modern-list
        '((?* . "•")
          (?+ . "‣")))
       (org-modern-fold-stars
        '(("▶" . "▼")
          ("▷" . "▽")
          ("▸" . "▾")
          ("▹" . "▿")))
       (org-modern-checkbox
        '((?X . "✔")
          (?- . "┅")
          (?\s . " ")))
       (org-modern-label-border 1)
       :hook
       (org-mode . org-modern-mode)
       (org-agenda-finalize . org-modern-agenda))

3 Block indentation
*******************

Since version 2.0, this package also incorporates ‘org-modern-indent’,
which provides block bracket styling when ‘org-indent-mode’ is enabled,
including support for "bulk-indented" blocks nested within plain lists:

   ‘org-modern-indent’ is disabled by ‘org-modern’ by default.
Configure ‘org-modern-block-indent=t’ to enable.  To activate
‘org-indent-mode’ in all org files, set ‘org-startup-indented=t’.

   *Note*: Currently ‘org-modern-indent’ requires zero ‘line-spacing’,
as it leads to gaps in the vertical bars drawn to indicate blocks, but
hopefully this can be improved in the future.

* Font spacing and faces::


File: docMur2WM.info,  Node: Bulk-indented blocks (eg within plain lists),  Next: Font spacing and faces,  Up: Block indentation

3.1 Bulk-indented blocks (e.g. within plain lists):
===================================================

Bulk-indented blocks have "real" (space/tab) indentation applied and
managed by org.  This extra indentation is applied by org on top of the
(fake, prefix-based) indentation used by org-indent.  To nest blocks
properly within such indented content, e.g.  in plain list items, you
only have to begin the ‘#+begin’ at the same level as the list element’s
text.

   As an important principle, ‘org-modern-indent’ does not alter the
contents of the text in your org documents, not even indentation.  It
just styles what is there.  To help achieve proper block bulk-indented
alignment, here are a few ways to alter blocks indentation using org and
other commands:

   • *Start things right*: Hit return after your last line of text (e.g
     in a list item), then immediately hit ‘C-c C,’ to create the
     desired block.  It will be indented at the right level:

          - This list item contains a:
            - sublist, which holds a block:
              [C-c C-,] here

   • *Move flush left*: Note: ‘M-{’ will get you to the start of a block
     quickly.  ‘M-\’ at block start will move the block’s first header
     line to column 0.  Then ‘M-S-left’ (or ‘right’) will indent the
     full block.
   • *Indent rigidly*: ‘M-h’ selects the entire block.  Then ‘C-x TAB’
     enters "rigid indent" mode, after which left/right moves the entire
     block.
   • *Re-indent a block*: If you have a block that is partially aligned,
     perhaps with a "hanging end", like so:


          - List 1
              - List 2
                #+begin_src lang
                   foo_lang(x)
                #+end_src

     you can simply use ‘M-S-left/right’ at block start (or in fact
     anywhere on the block header/footer) to ‘org-indent-block’.  Note
     that ‘org-src-preserve-indentation=nil’ is an important setting, to
     allow org to (re-)indent blocks to respect the local indentation
     inside list and other elements.  Also note that (from
     ‘org-indent-region’):

          The function will not indent contents of example blocks, verse
          blocks and export blocks as leading white spaces are assumed
          to be significant there.

3.2 Font spacing and faces
==========================

The default ‘fixed-pitch’ font (from which ‘org-meta-line’ inherits) has
line spacing >1.0 on some systems.  This will introduce gaps even if
your default font is changed, and ‘line-space’ is nil.  To correct it,
add:

     (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :family "Hack" :height 1.0) ; or whatever font family

3.2.1 The bracket style
-----------------------

If you’d like a different face than ‘org-meta-line’ for the "bracket",
configure the ‘org-modern-indent-bracket-line’ face.

4 Incompatibilities
*******************

   • ‘org-num-mode’ interferes with the ‘org-modern’ prettification of
     TODO keywords.
   • ‘visual-wrap-prefix-mode’ relies on the ‘wrap-prefix’ text property
     which is also used by ‘org-modern’.
   • ‘org-modern-indent-mode’ is incompatible with non-zero
     ‘line-spacing’.

5 Alternatives
**************

The tag style of ‘org-modern’ is inspired by Nicholas Rougier’s
svg-tag-mode (https://github.com/rougier/svg-tag-mode).  In contrast to
‘svg-tag-mode’, the package ‘org-modern’ avoids images and uses more
efficient Emacs box text properties.  By only styling the text via text
properties, the styled text, e.g., dates or tags stay editable and are
easy to interact with.

   The approach used here restricts the flexibility (e.g., no rounded
corners) and creates dependence on the size and alignment of the font.
Combining ‘org-modern-mode’ with ‘svg-tag-mode’ is possible.  You can
use SVG tags and use the table and block styling from ‘org-modern’.  If
you are interested in further tweaks, Emacs comes with the builtin
‘prettify-symbols-mode’ which can be used for individual styling of
custom keywords.

   Alternatives are the older org-superstar
(https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode) and org-bullets
(https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets) packages, which are more limited
and mainly adjust headlines and lists.  ‘org-superstar’ relies on
character composition, while ‘org-modern’ uses text properties, which
are considered more future-proof.  Note that ‘org-modern’ is a full
replacement for both ‘org-superstar’ and ‘org-bullets’.  You can disable
styling of certain elements, e.g., ‘org-modern-timestamp’, if you only
want to use the subset of ‘org-modern’ equivalent to ‘org-superstar’.
